# HTML Table Generator

**HTML Table Generator** is a WPF application that makes the process of writing HTML table code easier. It takes input from the user and generates the HTML table code accordingly.

## Backstory

I was working on an Ebook file that I intended to read on my kindle. The file had a lot of Japanese dialogue texts and vocabulary that needed to be formatted into an HTML table so that the kindle can display it nicely.
I also had to make sure it supports Japanese furigana by using the *ruby* tag.

Now coding this by hand was very tedious and close to impossible. So, I decided to make a tool that can automate the process. The HTML Table Generator is the result of that, along with another tool, the **FuriganaTool**.
